 * MCP "roots" path sandboxing.

 * MCP clients can advertise a set of filesystem "roots" (file:// URIs) that
 * scope which directories a server is allowed to touch. Harbor's upload_file
 * (localPath) and download_file (destPath) read/write the local disk, so we
 * confine those paths to the client's declared roots when they exist.
 *
 * Policy: **enforce-when-present, fail-open-when-absent.** If the client
 * declares roots, a path outside every root is rejected. If the client does
 * not support roots (or lists none), we allow the path and log a notice — this
 * keeps the server usable with clients that haven't adopted roots yet.
